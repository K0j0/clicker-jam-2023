New sequence tracking...
Tracking sequence flag > Sets true on tap > Sets false on a certain kind of tap > OnTap: store notes and delta time from previous note in sequence. On last note of sequence: Compare with previous sequence > If close enough to match > Start loop interval > Schedule sound to play ahead starting at interval from last note of previous sequence to first note of current one. Interval should be like half that time. > At interval repeat the note (this is if doing setTimeout, with setInterval this wouldn't be necessary.

Have way to export, save beats. Load beats?
Add optional metronome tick and BPM slider
Eventually add audio filters and stuff
2 buttons on beat. One starts/continues and the other confirms/ends.
New button could appear when a Sequence is detected. Pressing could start the sequence.

Ok, new approach. Now going to have music measures.
-Measures are a certain length > During tick store eat tap for that measure > lastMeasure > Clear taps on new measure > Compare taps this measure to lastMeasure > If same notes, and similar times then mark that > After 3 repeats then play that sound automatically > If no input for awhile stop playing auto sounds



-Sequence detection and looping.
Have a function running every frame/tick > Test playing a sound at certain times > Keep track of the last 10 button pressed and when > Try to identify a pattern

-To find rhythm:
Iterate over all elements > Keep track of first and last time of a note > identify largest gap > What are the notes between > What are the intervals between those notes? > Store as lastFrame > Do it again on first frame > Do the notes match a known beat? > Are the intervals close enough too? > When was that beat learned > If x amount of time has passed then automatically play that beat until there's no tapping for 5 seconds

-Fullscreen?
-Get width and height > figure out which is smaller > make that the width > set height to 16:9 of that

-Add UI that shows number counting up
-Make tapping button count up number
-Have array of sound sources so that multiple sounds can play
-Add down state to button and maybe raising up anim
-Add greensock tweening to project
