Ok, new approach. Now going to have music measures.
-Measures are a certain length > During tick store eat tap for that measure > lastMeasure > Clear taps on new measure > Compare taps this measure to lastMeasure > If same notes, and similar times then mark that > After 3 repeats then play that sound automatically > If no input for awhile stop playing auto sounds



-Sequence detection and looping.
Have a function running every frame/tick > Test playing a sound at certain times > Keep track of the last 10 button pressed and when > Try to identify a pattern

-To find rhythm:
Iterate over all elements > Keep track of first and last time of a note > identify largest gap > What are the notes between > What are the intervals between those notes? > Store as lastFrame > Do it again on first frame > Do the notes match a known beat? > Are the intervals close enough too? > When was that beat learned > If x amount of time has passed then automatically play that beat until there's no tapping for 5 seconds

-Fullscreen?
-Get width and height > figure out which is smaller > make that the width > set height to 16:9 of that

-Add UI that shows number counting up
-Make tapping button count up number
-Have array of sound sources so that multiple sounds can play
-Add down state to button and maybe raising up anim
-Add greensock tweening to project
